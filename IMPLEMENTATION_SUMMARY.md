- **Game Status**: Displays lives remaining, wins/losses, guessed letters
- **Visual Feedback**: Animated letter reveals and hangman drawing
- **Game Results**: Win/lose messages with final word reveal

#### 3. Game Logic Requirements ✅
- **Letter Guessing**: Single letter input with validation
- **Input Validation**: A-Z only, case-insensitive, duplicate prevention
- **Guess Processing**: Correct/incorrect feedback, life tracking
- **Win/Lose Conditions**: Complete word or 6 incorrect guesses

#### 4. Game Flow Requirements ✅
- **Initialization**: Random word selection, game state setup
- **Progression**: Continuous letter guessing with immediate feedback
- **Completion**: Game over modal with statistics and replay option
